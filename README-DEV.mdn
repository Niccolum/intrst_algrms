Step one: Make any changes you need and commit it as usual.

Step two: call verup script in working directory (see verup script)

Step three: push all changes and tags

Script has 1 parameter with three options:

    ./verup major - Only for "Breaking changes"
    ./verup minor - Something new was added to Contract (some big changes).
    ./verup patch - Contract updates (little changes).

Script should have chmod a+x.
