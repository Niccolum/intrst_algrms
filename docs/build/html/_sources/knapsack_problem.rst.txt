Knapsack problem
================

Some Theory:

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization.

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number 
of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less 
than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

It derives its name from the problem faced by someone, 
who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.
