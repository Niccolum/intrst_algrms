# Instruments and algorithms

Here is examples of realizations several algorithms, they performance, memory used and result plots.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Python 3.6+ (because of type checking)

### Installing

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e git+https://github.com/Niccolum/intrst_algrms#egg=Intrst_algrms
cd env/src/intrst_algrms
```

#### Note:

*For check memory tests - install line_profiler manually.*

*This package not in package because of problem with installation. Details [here](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler#installation)*

After that you can run commands from results.md on each folders.

More detailed description and HOW-TO:

Results of research algorithms here:
* [Binary Tree (sorting)](binary_tree/results.md)
* [Knapsack problem](knapsack_problem/results.md)
* [Unpacking nested lists of indefinite depth](unpacking_flatten_lists/results.md)
